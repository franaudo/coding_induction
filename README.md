# Coding tutorials

## Basics

In the `basics` folder you will find the basic know-how to get started coding with python and collaborating with other people in a productive way.

Tutorials in this folder:

0. `python` : contains instructions to install python, conda and additional libraries; a python IDE is suggested and a basic script is built with it.
1. `git` : contains instructions to work with `git`, a *version control system* that is widely used to collaborate on software development.

## Later on

More advanced tutorials will be included in this folder.
