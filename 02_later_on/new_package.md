# Folder Structure [WIP]

* `_examples`   --> test and example code
* `database`   --> folder containing the data about the slabs
* `queries`    --> here goes the code to generate plots and query the database
* `temp` --> you can create a temp folder where you can dump any sort of files: these will be ignored by git and never pushed in the main repository on GitHub.
